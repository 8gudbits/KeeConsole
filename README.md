# KeeConsole - Personal Password Manager

Introducing KeeConsole ‚Äì my brainchild, the 8gudbits's personal password manager project! This creation is like a recipe that combines Batch files, PowerShell scripts, Python wizardry, and even a touch of C++ console sorcery (I swear, no magical creatures were harmed in the process). What's the result? A user-friendly, interactive interface that'll make managing passwords as enjoyable as a tickle fight with a friendly robot.

Now, picture this: My buddy [ConsolePassX](https://github.com/MagenusSkyler/ConsolePassX) threw down the gauntlet with his creation, ConsolePassX. Challenge accepted! KeeConsole emerged from the coding cauldron, aiming to be the coolest password manager in town ‚Äì funky yet functional, like a disco ball with a hidden safe inside.

So there you have it ‚Äì KeeConsole, the password protector that's cooler than a polar bear's shades. MagenusSkyler, thanks for the challenge, my friend! üöÄüîê

## Features

- **Security**: Your passwords and sensitive data are handled with security in mind. The utilization of Python encryption ensures your information remains protected from unauthorized access. Better then ConsolePassX. üòâ

- **User-Friendly Interaction**: By incorporating C++ console plugins ([cmdmenusel](https://github.com/TheBATeam/CmdMenuSel-by-Judago)), the password manager offers a distinctive mouse-driven interaction within the console, enhancing user experience and navigation.

- **Add Entries with Ease**: Quickly add new entries to your password manager. Simply input the necessary details such as website title, username, and password.

- **Modify Entries**: Effortlessly update information for any stored entry. Whether it's a change in username, password, or other details, KeeConsole has you covered.

- **Search with Precision**: Find specific entries by searching based on the website's username or title, saving you time when you need your information quickly.

- **Remove Entries Securely**: Dispose of unwanted entries from the database, ensuring that your data remains organized and manageable.

## Attention, party people!

Hold onto your ones and zeroes because my coding comrade MagenusSkyler has dropped a digital bombshell ‚Äì he's waving goodbye to coding! Yep, you read that right. He's trading code for coconut drinks on a sandy beach, or something equally exotic. üèùÔ∏èüçπ

But don't you worry, his coding legacy lives on! Dive into his creation and prepare to be blown away by customization options that could make even a chameleon blush. And a quick shoutout to MagenusSkyler: Thanks for the coding escapades, buddy! (P.S. Don't panic, he's still alive and kicking ‚Äì no dramatic exits here.) üíªüéâ
